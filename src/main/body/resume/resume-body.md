## Recent Experience (Situation, Behavior, & Outcome)

#### Director of Curriculum at V School (June 2018 – Oct. 2018)

- S: V School had developed an industry-vetted Full Stack JavaScript course but needed help making instruction processes and student outcomes more consistent. We also needed a model to start from when creating new courses including Experience Design (UX/UI) and Data Science.
- B: I worked with the education team to refine our educational philosophies and define our strategies in measurable processes that could be replicated in courses teaching other content formats. I also partnered with the Head of Education to manage the implementation of a custom-tailored learning management system.
- O: V School is launching two new courses in Oct. 2018 and Nov. 2018: Experience Design and Data Science. The Full Stack JavaScript educational team is building a custom-tailored learning management system that will used across the entire organization.

#### Admissions Instructor at V School (Jan. 2018 – June 2018)

- S: New students coming into V School's Full Stack JavaScript program often need mentoring through pre-course work to get up to speed for day 1 of the bootcamp. Course instructors were only able to offer limited time and help due to their primary focus being toward students currently attending the course.
- B: I joined the team to focus primarily on helping these incoming students. I created interactive lesson content covering incoming student's most common questions so that we could spend more mentoring time on deeper subjects.
- O: Students began arriving to day 1 of the bootcamp with a deeper knowledge of JavaScript and DOM principles than before. As a result, the course instructors were able to spend more time teaching additional skills and subjects.

#### Account Manager at Renown Health (June 2015 – Sept. 2018)

- S: Renown's Occupational Health Network serves 1,400+ employers' drug testing, workers' compensation, and occupational health needs across 11 urgent care and 3 ER locations. Account retention had recently been split out from sales into account management.
- B: I was the primary liaison to employers, insurers, and third-party administrators on behalf of Renown, representing medical providers, clinic staff, and urgent care & ER leadership. I trained staff and leaders for all locations and implemented lean standard work to support process and their improvement.
- O: Operational coding and billing errors were reduced across all sites from 8% to 2%. The program grew to 1,700 employers primarily based on marketing and word-of-mouth.

#### Sales Account Manager at Keep Supply (Feb. 2012 – June 2015)

- S: I was promoted from Temp to Sales Assistant to Technical Account Manager to Sales Account Manager within 2 years. In my final role, I took responsibility for my VP's sales accounts in Washington state and Oregon.
- B: I coordinated between prison and jail administrators, internal and external technical teams, and our operations team to deliver commissary and security solutions. I focused on selling and implementing technology efforts that paid for themselves and maintaining aggressive but fair margins for high sales volume product lines.
- O: Revenue for my territory increased by 10%, and GP increased by 12% for my territories in my first 12 months as a Sales Account Manager. I was granted additional territory in Northern California.
