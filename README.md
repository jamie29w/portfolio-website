# Portfolio Website

My first fully deployed Single Page App, built with React and fully responsive design. I built this site to act as a landing page to make my programming portfolio, resume, and social profiles accessible to prospective employers and business partners.

I spun up this site using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and deployed it with [Surge](https://surge.sh/).
